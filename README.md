Next, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.

Install the necessary packages by running the command
npm install.

Finally, move to the vite-project directory and execute 
npm run dev.

At this point, your website is operational.

For the backend, I used Strapi. To launch the backend server, run the command
npm run develop in the api directory.

Finally, you can view the website.
